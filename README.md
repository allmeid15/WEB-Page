# About web-page
This is the first project that i worked solely alone. It's a simple project that manages simple CRUD operations for the admin, while it's a webpage for the customer where the customer can look at the menu items, scroll through them and finally make an order. 
Its created primarily with HTML, CSS, procedural PHP for CRUD operations and some Javascript functions to manage the order and submit.
